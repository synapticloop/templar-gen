<h3>templar-gen</h3>

<p>
	templar-gen was coded in a couple of hours to generate static pages just like 
	this one.  It is a very simple system that generates static pages utilising the 
	templar templating language from synapticloop.
</p>

<h3>Page cutting</h3>

<p>The generation of pages revolves around determining the common parts of the 
page, extracting them and including them in multiple files.</p>

<p>The basic commands for including snippets of a page are one of:</p>

<ol>
	<li><code>{{import filename}</code> when you want to include the file and parse the contents (with templar)</li>
	<li><code>{{static filename}</code> when you want to include the static contents of the file without parsing the contents</li>
	<li><code>{{statichtml filename}</code> when you want to include the static contents of the file and output escaped HTML</li>
</ol>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p>
	Get the latest code from <a href="https://github.com/synapticloop/templar-gen/releases">the templar-gen</a> 
	releases directory.
<p>

<p><em>(You will want the <code>templar-gen-&lt;version&gt;<strong>-all</strong>.jar</code> jar file)</em></p>

<h4>Command line</h4>

<p>run it with the following</p>

<pre><code>
java -jar templar-gen.jar &lt;input_directory&gt; &lt;output_directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course use <a href="/ant.html">Ant</a> or <a href="/gradle.html">Gradle</a></p>

<h4>Which files are generated</h4>

<p>
	In order for pages to be generated, you need to have both the file and a 
	context file in the directory that is going to be created.  If you have a 
	look at the source code for this site - you will see the layout.
</p>

<p>For example, in the src directory:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>index.html</code> this is the index.html page</li>
	<li><code>index.html.context</code> this is where you can place variables for the index.html page</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the <code>.context</code> file means that the file will be generated into the <code>output_directory</code></p>

<p>This page was generated with the following command line:</p>

<pre><code>
java -jar templar-gen.jar src .
</code></pre>
